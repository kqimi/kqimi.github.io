During our work on the Campus Plate Mate project, our team practiced effort estimation and tracked our time spent on issues through GitHub. Although our estimates were often inaccurate—sometimes significantly off—the process of making them still provided unexpected benefits. It helped us develop a more mindful approach to planning, time management, and team coordination throughout the semester.

## Making the Time Effort
To make our effort estimates, we relied primarily on intuition and previous experience with similar coding tasks. When creating a GitHub issue or tackling a user story, we would make a rough guess about how long it would take based on the complexity we expected. For example, adding a new API route or fixing a styling issue might be estimated as one or two hours, while integrating authentication or connecting to the Supabase database could be three to five hours. However, these estimates often didn’t account for hidden challenges, such as deployment bugs on Vercel or unexpected errors during Prisma migrations.

## Benefits
Even though the estimates were rarely accurate, there was still value in creating them. They gave us a starting point for breaking down tasks and managing expectations. Having even a rough estimate encouraged us to think more critically about the scope of a task before jumping into it. It also made it easier to plan our weekly workload, especially since many of us were balancing the project with jobs or other classes.

Tracking actual effort had definite benefits. It allowed us to reflect on where our time was going and helped us evaluate which tasks should have been broken down further or better scoped. It also became a reference point when discussing sprint velocity during team meetings. There weren’t many downsides, aside from the minor hassle of remembering to log time. Occasionally, it felt like tracking was an extra burden—especially during late-night coding sessions when we just wanted to finish a task and sleep.

In total, the overhead of estimating and tracking time was minimal, and the insights we gained were worth it. It helped us recognize the value of planning and made our retrospective discussions more meaningful. If we could do it again, we would probably adopt a more consistent method—perhaps integrating a lightweight time tracking tool directly into GitHub issues or assigning specific teammates to monitor progress.

In conclusion, although our estimates weren’t always accurate, the act of estimating and tracking effort made us more aware of our workflow. It encouraged better planning, allowed for honest reflection, and improved our team communication. In future projects, I would continue using this process—with a few refinements—as it ultimately contributed to a smoother and more intentional development experience.
